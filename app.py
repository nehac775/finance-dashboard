"""
Financial Dashboard (my version)

Why I built it:
---------------
I wanted to practice working with financial datasets and visualizations.
The goal was to track balances, incomes, and expenses across time.
This gave me practice with pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit layouts.

Notes & Struggles:
------------------
- My first version had charts overlapping ‚Üí fixed by using st.columns().
- CSV import/export was buggy until I forced float conversions.
- At first I hardcoded sample data, then switched to uploadable CSV.
- TODO: Add authentication (so multiple users can save dashboards).
- TODO: Add comparison chart vs last month.
- TODO: Add ability to connect live to an API (e.g., stock or bank data).
